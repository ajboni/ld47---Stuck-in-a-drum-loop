# Stuck in a (drum) loop...

This game is an experiment done in 72hs for for Ludum Dare 47 game jam. Theme: Stuck in a loop.
The goal is to collect all drum parts (the purple blocks).
Each time a new drum part is collected its associated track starts playing and the beat gets faster.
Press start game and use Arrow Keys to move. Good Luck!
